# Python Coding Practice Problems ðŸš€

This repository is my personal journey of solving **3000 Python problems**.  
Currently: **200+ problems solved**, and growing daily.  

The problems are organised by:
- **Simple** (basic syntax & logic, loops, functions, OOP)
- **Topic-specific** (Strings, Lists, Control Flow, etc.)

Each folder has:
- `Questions.md` â†’ list of problems
- `Solutions.md` â†’ Python solutions with explanations

## ðŸ“Œ Progress
âœ… Simple Part â†’ 100+ done  

âœ… Control Flow â†’ 20+ done

âœ… Lists  â†’ 20+ done

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal
To create a **public learning resource** for programmers preparing for interviews, coding challenges, or just practicing Python.
