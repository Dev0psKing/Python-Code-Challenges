## Question 
Write a Python program to find those numbers which are divisible by 7 and multiples of 5, between 1500 and 2700 (both included).

## Solution 
```python
result = []
for i in range(1500, 2700):
    if i % 7 == 0 and i % 5 == 0:
        result.append(i)
print(result)
```
## Question 2
Write a Python program to convert temperatures to and from Celsius and Fahrenheit.

[ Formula : c/5 = f-32/9 [ where c = temperature in celsius and f = temperature in fahrenheit ]

Expected Output :

60째C is 140 in Fahrenheit
45째F is 7 in Celsius

```python

celsius = int(input("Enter Celsius: "))
fahrenheit= int(input("Enter Fahrenheit: "))

# Application of the formular
formularCelsius = (celsius * 9/5) + 32
formularFahrenheit = (fahrenheit - 32) * 5/9
print(f"{celsius}째C is {int(formularCelsius)} in Fahrenheit")
print(f"{fahrenheit}째F is {int(formularFahrenheit)} in Celsius")

```

## Question 3
Write a Python program to guess a number between 1 and 9.

Note : User is prompted to enter a guess. If the user guesses wrong then the prompt appears again until the guess is correct, on successful guess, user will get a "Well guessed!" message, and the program will exit.

## Solution 
```python
