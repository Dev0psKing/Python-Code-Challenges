## Question 1
Write a Python program to find those numbers which are divisible by 7 and multiples of 5, between 1500 and 2700 (both included).

## Question 2
Write a Python program to convert temperatures to and from Celsius and Fahrenheit.

[ Formula : c/5 = f-32/9 [ where c = temperature in celsius and f = temperature in fahrenheit ]

Expected Output :

60°C is 140 in Fahrenheit
45°F is 7 in Celsius

## Question 3
Write a Python program to guess a number between 1 and 9.

Note : User is prompted to enter a guess. If the user guesses wrong then the prompt appears again until the guess is correct, on successful guess, user will get a "Well guessed!" message, and the program will exit.

## Question 4
Write a Python program that accepts a word from the user and reverses it.

## Question 5
Write a Python program to count the number of even and odd numbers in a series of numbers
Sample numbers : numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) 

Expected Output :
Number of even numbers : 5
Number of odd numbers : 4

## Question 6 
Write a Python program that prints all the numbers from 0 to 6 except 3 and 6.

Note : Use 'continue' statement.

Expected Output : 0 1 2 4 5

## Question 7
Write a Python program to get the Fibonacci series between 0 and 50.

Note : The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers :

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ....
Every next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it.

Expected Output : 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34

## Question 8
Write a Python program to construct the following pattern, using a nested for loop.

## Question
Write a Python program that iterates the integers from 1 to 50. For multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers that are multiples of three and five, print "FizzBuzz".

Sample Output :

fizzbuzz
1
2
fizz
4
buzz

Write a Python program that takes two digits m (row) and n (column) as input and generates a two-dimensional array. The element value in the i-th row and j-th column of the array should be i*j.

Note :
i = 0,1.., m-1
j = 0,1, n-1.

Test Data : Rows = 3, Columns = 4
Expected Result : [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 2, 3], [0, 2, 4, 6]]

## Question 
Write a Python program that accepts a string and calculates the number of digits and letters.

Sample Data : Python 3.2

Expected Output :

Letters 6
Digits
